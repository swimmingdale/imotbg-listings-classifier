# imot.bg listing classifier
This application can help you choose a real estate for rent using www.imot.bg site.

Using the presumption that most listings on bulgarian sites offered for rent are not current.
They are not present right now on the market. When you choose one of them and call the phone
what happens is that usually nobody picks up the phone and in a few days somebody calls you
but from a different phone number and telling you that the listing you are asking about is already
not available. This way they are winning you as a clint and offer you worse and more expensive ones.

They say that around 80-90% of all listings for rent are not current.

The way the application works is by mapping phones to listings. We presume that the least repetitive phone numbers
are more probably ones offered from persons istead of real estate brokers.
This application does not guarantee that least repetitive phone numbers in listings are current.
